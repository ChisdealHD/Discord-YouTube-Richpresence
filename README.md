# Discord YouTube Richpresence
A Discord Richpresence for YouTube, so that people can see what you are listening to!

Note this is Windows only.

## Set-up
I use [this library](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) its DiscordRPC.dll as Library to work on the Project.

There is no current NuGet available so you have to get it from there and you're good to go.

## Features 
1. Shows what you listen to
1. Timestamp (Where you currently are)
1. Shows when you are idling

## To be added
1. Support for other Browsers **(Currently only Chrome)**
1. Request to join session
1. Invite others to join your session (Almost simultaneously listening)

Maybe more features in the feature, but this will be the main features.

## How it looks like
